**Story Outline**
The Story Outline maps out the big events that occur in the game, matching each event to its corresponding part of dramatic structure. We used this part of the prototype to determine how we wanted to theme each level, with the levels telling one of the events. 

- The first level is the exposition, with Spot noticing before everyone else that the mother is sick by smelling the cancer.
- The second and third levels are the rising action, with the family getting the cancer diagnosis and starting to respond according to their stage of grief.
- The fourth level is the climax, with the fight between the daughter and the father, showing everyone at their peak stage of grief.
- The fifth level is the falling action, where Leah falls and goes to the hospital, with the family coming together to go with her.
- The epilogue level is the resolution, showing the player one of two endings, depending on how well they helped the family deal with their grief. In both endings, Leah dies, but in one the family is able to stay together, where in the other the family falls apart.

By doing this storyline map, we were able to come up with a new ending. Originally, Leah survived in the happy ending. We chose to change this to her dying in both because we wanted the message of the game to be about how to deal with grief in healthy ways. We felt that the original ending may come across that “life sucks when cancer wins,” so we want to show that even if something horrible happens, you can overcome it if you deal with your pain and grief in healthy ways.

**Close up of Grief Designations**
Also while we were working on the storyline map, we came up with the idea of matching each character with one of the stages of grief. The character’s actions and ways of coping with Leah’s sickness will reflect the stage they were given.

**House Mockup, Game Locations, and Deciding View**
For this part of the prototype, we came up with a list of areas the levels would take place in. This was to get idea of what rooms of the house we will need to design background art for.

We also came up with a very quick mockup of how we want to represent the house. We decided to go with a 2d, side-view look at each room. We made this quick house mockup to get a general idea of how the rooms interact with each other so that we don’t forget what is next to each other and make mistakes when animating transitions. We also decided on the family’s last name, the Osterheim family, while drawing up the house.

In the photo below, we worked out the view of the game. Initially, we thought about making it first person, through the eyes of the dog. We felt this would make animating scenes harder, and figured going with a simple 2D, side view would make the coding easier so we could focus more on getting the story right. The side view would allow us to show more information on screen to the players, including background stuff that may have been lost in a first person view. We also drew up how transitioning to animation might look, but decided we would focus first on making the dialogue screens first and to revisit the transition scenes if we had time.

**Family Tree**
For this part of the prototype, we drew out the relationships between each character and gave them sample art depictions.

We also hashed out how we wanted to represent language in the game, since the dog shouldn’t be able to understand most of it. We put our influences down as the adults talking in Peanuts cartoons/tv specials, and the language in the Sims.

**Sample Dialogue Tree Scene and Happiness Meter Representations**
For this part of the prototype, we drew up a sample of how we wanted to draw each level, going through a dialogue tree to progress through the game.

We used this part to walk through how the game works, and will represent that below with pictures representing the choices the player makes.

At this point we decided where to place the happiness meters on screen. We decided they should be on screen at all times so the player isn’t focusing on trying to remember them, but we placed them on the bottom to make them less distracting.

We also came up with a way of showing people how the meters fluctuate as the result of their choices in the dialogue tree. We made meters for each character, with 10 spots in each. We placed fuzzy balls on top to act as segments of the meter. 

The meters in the actual games will be solid bars that grow and shrink as they fluctuate.

**Stepping Through the Dialogue Screen**
The player is presented with the first scene. They are given three choices in the dialogue tree. They tap on the choice they wish to make with their finger, simulating using a mouse to click.

If the player chose “A,” they are presented with the “chose mom” scene. In this scene, we tried to simulate how we want to do the perform tricks mechanic. The player says which trick they want to perform, since in the game we would have them press the corresponding number on the keyboard.

If the player chooses “A,” Spot’s and Leah’s happiness meters increment. If the player chooses “B,” “C,” or “D,” the meters decrement.

If the player chose “B,” they are presented with the “chose dad” scene. The player touches the highlighted object they wish to choose, out of the choices: rope, hat, coat, or newspaper.

If the player chooses the paper, Spot’s and James’s happiness meters increment. If the player chooses anything else the meters decrement.

If the player chose “C,” they are presented with the “chose children” scene. The player touches the highlighted object they wish to choose, out of the choices: stick, ball, rope, or backpack.

If the player chooses the stick, rope, or ball, Spot’s, Chris’s, and Ben’s happiness meters increment. If the player chooses the backpack, the meters decrement.
