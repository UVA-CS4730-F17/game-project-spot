#Spot
The family leaves the house to go to work and school. [p] 
Spot is sad that they are gone, but knows that they will come back later. [p]
He lays by the front door and waits for their return,  barking at squirrels that walk on the lawn and napping in the sunlight. [p]
A few hours later, the family comes home. Spot greets everyone as they walk through the door. [p]
They all head to their rooms, except Leah, who goes to the kitchen to cook dinner. [p]
Spot wants to follow one of them, but who will it be? [p]
