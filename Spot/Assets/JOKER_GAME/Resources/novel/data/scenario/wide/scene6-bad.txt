#Spot
A few days pass.[p]
Spot spends each one sitting by the door, hoping Leah would come in any second now. She doesn’t.[p]
During these days, the rest of the family isn’t home much. The come home late each night, smelling of anesthetic. Some days they seem hopeful as they walk through the door, others not so much.[p]
After a week of waiting, Spot sees James’s car pull into the driveway late at night. He stands at the door, wagging his tail, hoping tonight would be the night Leah finally comes back.[p]
His heart sinks when he sees the family hobble out the car, each one of them barely holding back tears.[p]

As soon as they walk through the door, Ben rushes to Spot and wraps him in a hug. He’s shaking from crying so hard, and Spot’s fur gets wet from the tears.[p]
After a few minutes, James and Chris slowly usher Ben and Spot away from the door into the living room.[p]
Spot does not know what has happened, but he can tell it’s bad. He spends the rest of the evening staying close to Ben, sleeping next to his bed throughout the night.[p]
The next day, James, Chris, and Ben stay home instead of leaving for work and school. Their moods have not lightened, and they mostly stay in their own rooms, leaving only to grab food.[p]
Spot checks in on each person, noticing that James spends most of the day either talking on the phone and drinking.[p]

The following day everyone gets up and dresses in dark, formal clothing. They put a leash on Spot and lead him to the car. Normally he would get excited about the leash, but the mood tells him something is off.[p]
After a short car ride they arrive to a grassy area Spot has never seen before. There are a number of tall stones lined up in rows, some with flowers leaned up against them.[p]
The family walks silently through these rows until they get to a stone with a big hole in front of it.[p]
Next to the hole is a large box. The family stands next to this box as more people start congregating next to them. Spot recognizes some of them, cousins and friends that have visited the house.[p]
A few people talk while others cry or stand in solemn silence. After a while a few of them grab the box and slowly lower it into the ground. People shake hands and hug, then slowly leave one by one until only the family is left.[p]
They stay there for nearly an hour in silence that is only broken by the occasional sob from Ben. Then, they go home.[p]

The next few weeks are the darkest Spot has been through. Spot finally realizes Leah isn’t coming home. He stops waiting by the front door.[p]
James and Chris fight almost every night, with Ben hiding in his room with Spot trying to pretend this isn’t happening.[p]
When they aren’t fighting, James is in his room drinking scotch and staring at photos of Leah. Chris spends most of her in her room with her friend Meg.[p]
One day Chris leaves for school and never comes back, leaving behind a note to James telling him that she has moved away with Meg and that he shouldn’t come looking for her.[p]
Spot waits by the door each day hoping she might come back, but slowly realizes that like Leah, she is gone. He stops waiting by the door.[p]
Over the next few years, Spot focuses all of his attention to Ben, spending all of his waking hours either next to him or waiting for him to come home.[p] 
They may have lost half of their family, but they have each other, and that is enough.[p]
