#Spot
A few hours later, Chris and Ben return home from school. [p]
They are a little surprised that their parents are home earlier than them, but assume traffic must have been light that day. [p]
They spend the afternoon in their rooms doing homework and playing until they are called into the kitchen for dinner. [p]
Spot sits by the table hoping for scraps. [p]
He notices that James and Leah are quiet and a bit distracted during the meal, letting Chris and Ben do most of the talking. [p]
After the meal is over, Chris goes to leave the table, but James asks her to sit down again. [p]
James gets up and stands behind Leah. The two exchange glances, and then James starts talking to the three of them. [p]
James talks to the kids for a while, with Leah chiming in from time to time. Chris and Ben ask a lot of questions. [p]
Spot listens in, barely understanding anything he says, but based on the looks on everyone’s faces, it’s not very happy. [p]
He picks up a few words here and there, piecing together that something is wrong with Leah. [p]
Chris and Ben get up from the table and walk over to their mother. Leah gives both of them a hug as the kids begin to cry a bit. [p]
James stands next to them and assures them that they’ll get through this. [p]
Spot watches all of this and wishes he could help. [p]
He just doesn’t know what to do. He walks over to the them and leans against Leah’s feet, trying to show his solidarity. [p]
After hugging and talking for a while, the family leaves the kitchen and gets ready for bed. [p]
Spot notices that the mood is fairly gloomy and hopes that things will be back to normal in the morning. [p]
