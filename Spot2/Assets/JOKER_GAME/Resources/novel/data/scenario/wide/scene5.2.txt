#Spot
James, Chris, and Ben leave the house to go to work and school. [p]
Leah has been staying home during the day lately, spending her days in bed or on the couch. [p]
Spot lays by the couch and watches tv with her. [p]
After the two of them hang out on the couch for a few hours, Leah stands up to get a glass of water in the kitchen. Spot follows her. [p]
As she enters the kitchen, she starts coughing heavily. Her breaths between coughs are thin rasps. [p]
She takes a few steps towards a chair to sit in, but trips and falls to the ground. [p]
Spot runs over to her. She’s still conscious, but is crying and clutching her arm in pain. She cannot get up. [p]
Spot knows he needs to help but isn’t sure what he should do. [p]
He knows the family grabs the box with the plus sign on it whenever someone gets hurt. [p]
He also knows sometimes they speak into the small rectangular boxes to get advice when dealing with these sort of things. [p]
What should Spot grab? [p]

Spot runs over to the counter and grabs the box with the plus on it. [p]
He quickly brings it over to Leah, who grabs it gratefully. [p]
Spot watches Leah open the box and use a roll of elastic bandage to create a makeshift slip for her arm. [p]
She slowly stands up, using Spot as a balance. Once she’s on her feet, she walks over to her phone and calls James. [p]
Ten minutes later James is back at the house. He helps Leah into his car and they leave for the hospital. [p]
Spot is happy that James was able to get her, but has a nagging feeling that something is still off. [p]
