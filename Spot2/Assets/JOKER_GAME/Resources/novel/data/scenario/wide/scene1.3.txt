#Spot
The family leaves the house to go to work and school. [p]

A few hours later, the family comes home. Spot greets everyone as they walk through the door. [p]
The family has dinner together then retreat to their rooms while Leah cleans up. [p]
Spot wants to follow one of them, but who will it be? [p]
