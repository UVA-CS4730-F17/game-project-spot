#Spot
A few hours later, Chris and Ben come home. Spot greets them, then follows Chris around the house as she looks for Leah. [p]
When Chris can’t find her, she turns to Spot and asks, ‘Where’s mom?’ [p]
Spot walks towards the front door and points with his nose. [p]
Chris interprets this as Leah is not in the house and pulls out her phone. [p]
She talks to someone on the phone, then hangs up. [p]
Chris grabs Ben and brings him to the car. Spot watches them leave and feels concerned. [p]
;Chris had grown visibly upset as she talked on the phone, and had quickly ushered Ben into the car. [p]
Spot hopes that everything is ok, and sits by the door waiting for their return. [p]
Several hours pass. Spot grows hungry, but no one is there to feed him, so he continues to sit by the door. [p]
A few hours later, James, Chris, and Ben finally come home. Leah is not with them. [p]
Spot greets the three of them, but they barely notice him. [p]
Chris walks into the kitchen and quickly pours dog food into Spot’s bowl, then goes down to her room. [p]
Spot quickly scarfs down his food, then goes to find one of the family members. Who should he interact with? [p]

#Spot
Spot walks upstairs to James and Leah’s room. [p]
James is sitting at the desk, drinking straight from a bottle of scotch. [p]
Spot can tell James is not in a good state, but isn’t sure what he should do to help. [p]
Should he try to get James to put down the bottle or try to comfort him by nuzzling James and letting him know he is there for him. [p]

#Spot
Spot jumps up onto James’s lap, causing him to drop the bottle in surprise. [p]
The bottle falls to the floor and shatters, spilling the liquor onto the floor. [p]
James yells, ‘What the h***! Bad dog!’ He leaves the room to find a rag he can use to clean up the liquid. [p]
Spot feels awful about upsetting James and walks out of the room with his tail between his legs. [p]
An hour later, James’s head has cleared. [p]
He feels bad for yelling at Spot, so he goes to find him and comfort him as an apology for yelling him. [p]
James finds Spot in the living room and hugs him. [p]
Spot feels a little better, but is still upset about breaking the bottle. [p]
