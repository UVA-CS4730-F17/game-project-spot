#Spot
Spot wakes up and walks over to the kitchen to find the family having breakfast. [p]
It seems like a normal breakfast: James is at the head of the table drinking coffee. Leah is cooking bacon on the stove. Chris and Ben are sitting at the end of the table eating cereal. [p]
Yet things seem different too. Ben isn’t squirming at the table like normal. Chris is barely touching her food. James is solemnly staring at Leah, who is the most different of the family. [p]
She’s wearing a scarf over her head. She’s wheezing a bit and coughs every once and awhile. She looks exhausted. [p]
The atmosphere seems down. Spot doesn’t know what’s wrong but he wants to help. Who does he want to greet? [p]
