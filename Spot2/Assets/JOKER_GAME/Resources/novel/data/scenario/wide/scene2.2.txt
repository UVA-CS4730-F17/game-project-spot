#Spot
After breakfast, the family leaves the house for work and school. [p]
Spot spends the morning napping in the living room, waiting for them to return. [p]
James’s car pulls into the driveway a few hours earlier than usual. [p]
Spot runs to the door and is surprised to see Leah and James come inside. [p]
He greets them eagerly and notices they both smell odd, like the vet’s office but without the smell of other dogs. [p]
He also notices that while they both smiled and pet him, they were not as happy or excited as he had expected to be. [p]
In fact, they both seem a little sad. Leah is crying. [p]
Spot wants to help cheer them up, so he decides to bring them something. [p]
What should he get? [p]

#Spot
Spot walks into the living room and grabs a box of tissues off one of the side tables. [p]
He walks back to Leah and James, and offers the box. [p]
James appreciatively grabs the box and hands Leah a tissue, who uses it to dry her eyes. [p]
James rubs Spot’s head, and the three of them walk into the living room, where James and Leah spend the afternoon talking and watching tv. [p]

#Spot
Spot walks into the living room and picks up his rope toy. [p]
He trots back over to James and Leah and drops at their feet expectantly. [p]
James shakes his head and says, ‘Not right now, buddy.’ He then walks into the living room with Leah. [p]
Spot is puzzled over the fact that his attempt didn’t work. [p]
If he had been sad, the chance to play would’ve instantly cheered him up. [p]
Disappointed in himself, he walks into the living room and naps near Leah and James, who spend the afternoon talking and watching tv. [p]
